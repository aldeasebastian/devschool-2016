***To be done in Day 3***

### Small TimeSheet entry app

- You can add User, Task and Hours worked on a task
- In the table you must have one row per-user that shows:

    User | Tasks | Total Hours

- If total hours <= 4 display a red background
- If hours > 4 and < 6 display warning background
- If hours >= 6 display green background
- Use Bootstrap classes for showing the background
- The Tasks column displays an ordered list of user's task
- Sort the table by User name and total hours
- Get some initial values with AJAX

- Also add the gulp tasks done during the classroom

### Tips
- Object arrays and nested object arrays
- MDN Array Functions (google it)
